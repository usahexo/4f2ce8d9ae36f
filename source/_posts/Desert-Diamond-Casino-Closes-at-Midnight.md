#  Desert Diamond Casino Closes at Midnight

The Desert Diamond Casino in Tucson, Arizona closed at midnight on Saturday, February 2. The casino offered gaming machines and table games.

The closure left 430 employees without work. This is the second closure of the casino in less than two years. The first closure happened in May of 2018 when the casino was purchased by the Tohono O'odham Nation.

In a statement, the Tohono O'odham Nation said that the closure was due to "market conditions." They also said that they were committed to finding new employment for the employees affected by the closure.

This closure marks another blow to the local economy, which has been struggling in recent years. The city of Tucson has been trying to attract new businesses and investment, but so far has had little success.
