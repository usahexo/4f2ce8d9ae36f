#  Do You Know What 600 Means in Gambling Terms?

If you've ever gambled, you've likely heard the term "600" thrown around. But do you know what it means?

In gambling terms, 600 refers to a bet that pays out 6-to-1 when it wins. So, if you put $10 on a 600 bet and it comes in, you'll get back $60 - meaning you've made a $50 profit.

600 bets are relatively uncommon these days, though. They used to be more popular back in the day when casinos paid out less on other bets. Nowadays, most casinos will pay out around 7-to-1 on most bets, making 600 bets a bit less attractive.

Still, there's something about the potential for a big payout that makes 600 bets an interesting proposition for some gamblers. And if you're lucky enough to hit one, you'll definitely be happy you made the wager!
