#  What is the Tiki Wins game?

The Tiki Wins game is a casino game that is based on the traditional bingo game. The game uses a random number generator to choose numbers from 1 to 90. Players then mark off the numbers on their cards as they are called. If players get 5 numbers in a row, they win the prize for that row.

The game has 9 different prize levels, which range from $2 to $500. There is also a progressive jackpot which starts at $1,000 and increases by $100 each time it is not won.

Tiki Wins is available to play at both online casinos and land-based casinos.

#  How do you play the Tiki Wins game?

Tiki Wins is an online casino game that can be played on desktop and mobile devices. It is a five-reel slot machine game with 20 paylines that offers players the chance to win up to 100x their bet amount.

The objective of the game is to match symbols from left to right on the paylines in order to create winning combinations. Winning combinations will payout accordingly, with the most valuable being the Tiki statue symbol which pays out 5x your bet amount for five symbols on a payline.
