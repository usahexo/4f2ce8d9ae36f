#  Sports Bettors Can Place Bets on the Tennessee Titans in NJ!

The Tennessee Titans are the talk of the NFL preseason after an impressive performance in their week one matchup against the Green Bay Packers. The Titans cruised to a 31-17 victory, led by quarterback Marcus Mariota who threw for 256 yards and two touchdowns.

The Titans are now gearing up for their next preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which will take place on Friday, August 17th at 8:00 PM ET. This game is sure to be exciting, and sports bettors can place bets on the outcome at many online casinos in New Jersey.

There are many different betting options available for this game, including point spread bets, moneyline bets, and over/under bets. The Titans are favored to win by 3.5 points, and the over/under bet is set at 41.5 points.

Sports bettors who believe that the Titans will win by more than 3.5 points can place a wager on the Titans -6.5 spread. Conversely, those who believe that the Buccaneers will pull off an upset can wager on Tampa Bay +3.5 spread.

The moneyline betting options offer even more interesting matchups. Bettors who believe that the Titans will win can wager on them at -250 odds, while those who think that the Buccaneers will win can wager on them at +200 odds.

Finally, the over/under betting option offers a great way to make some profits whether the game is high scoring or low scoring. Bettors who believe that the over 41.5 points will be scored can wager on OVER, while those who believe that under 41.5 points will be scored can wager on UNDER.

#  NJ Sports Betting Sites To Offer Tennessee Titans Bets

The New Jersey Legislature has been hard at work to legalize sports betting in the state. NJ sports betting sites are expected to offer Tennessee Titans bets very soon. The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement released a proposed regulatory framework for licensing and operation of sports betting on August 1, 2018. So far, only four casinos have applied for an online gaming license: Meadowlands Racetrack, Monmouth Park, Borgata, and Resorts AC. 

Sports betting is big business and there is a lot of money to be made. The National Football League (NFL) has been fighting tooth and nail to keep sports gambling illegal. However, the tides seem to be turning as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May 2018, allowing states to legalized sports gambling within their borders. 

The NFL has had a monopoly on legal sports betting for decades, but that is all about to change. New Jersey is one of several states that have already begun preparations for legalized sports betting. There are many different ways to bet on football and now New Jersey residents will have their pick of NJ sports betting sites when it comes time to place those bets. 

You can bet on who will win the Super Bowl or you could bet on individual games. You can also bet on whether or not a team will cover the point spread or whether the total number of points scored in a game will be over or under a certain number. There are lots of different ways to wager on football and now New Jersey residents will have their pick of NJ sports betting sites when it comes time to place those bets. 

One thing that is for sure is that the NFL does not want its fans placing bets with offshore sportsbooks. The league has long claimed that doing so would compromise the integrity of the game. However, with billions of dollars up for grabs, it is easy to see why they would want a piece of the action themselves. The NFL may try to block NJ sports betting sites from offering Tennessee Titans bets, but they won’t be able to stop them all. 

There are already several well-known offshore sportsbooks that accept bets from New Jersey residents and they are likely to add markets for Tennessee Titans games as soon as NJ online casinos start offering them. So far, no date has been set for when NJ residents will be able to start placing bets on football games, but it should be sooner rather than later now that PASPA has been overturned.
