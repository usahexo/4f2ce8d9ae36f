#  find someone who bingo sport Egypt: Pharaohs win inaugural match against African champions

The Pharaohs started their 2020 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying campaign with a 1-0 victory over African champions Cameroon on Sunday. A first-half goal from Abdallah El Said was enough to separate the two sides in a match played at the Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria.

The win was an impressive one for Egypt, who are looking to make amends for their group stage exit from the last AFCON finals. Their opponents were not an easy nut to crack, with Cameroon having won the tournament in 2017.

For Pharaohs coach Shawky Gharib, the match was a good opportunity to test his squad ahead of next year’s AFCON finals, which will be hosted by Cameroon. He made some changes to the team that lost 2-1 to Zimbabwe in an international friendly late last month.

Captain Ahmed Hegazi and midfielder Tarek Hamed both made their returns after recovering from injury, while Mohamed “Salah” Abdelrahman was handed a starting berth. There were also places in the squad for 21-year-old forward Amr Warda and midfielder Islam Mohareb, both of whom are coming through the national team’s youth ranks.

The match against Cameroon also saw goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy make his official debut for the Pharaohs. The Al Ahly shot-stopper replaced veteran Essam El Hadary between the posts.

El Said’s goal came in the 41st minute when he headed home powerfully from close range after being set up by Mohamed Salah inside the penalty area. The Liverpool talisman came close to doubling his side’s lead on a number of occasions in the second half but was denied by some good saves from goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa.

It was not all good news for Gharib and his players, however, as defender Mahmoud Hamdi received his second yellow card of qualifying and will miss the next match against Kenya later this month.

CAIRO - Al Ahly’s dream of lifting their first-ever Afcon title was shattered on Wednesday night as they went down to a thrilling 3-2 defeat against South Africa’s Supersport United in the semi-final staged at the Cairo International Stadium.

A capacity crowd of 64,000 fans were on hand to witness an absorbing match, which could have gone either way, but it was United who eventually edged out the hosts with two late goals from Bradley Grobler and Thuso Phala.

The first 45 minutes saw both teams go close to taking the lead, with United goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse making a couple of excellent saves to deny Ahmed Hegazi and Mohamed Elneny, while Ahly striker Amr Warda had a shot saved by Pieterse and then hit the post with another effort.

The opening goal finally arrived 10 minutes into the second half and it was Warda who got it, slotting home clinically after being put through by Ayman Hefny.

United hit back almost immediately though as Sibusiso Khumalo equalized with a well-taken strike, and the game see-sawed from then on with both sides creating chances.

Extra time was required to separate the teams and in the end it was United who prevailed thanks to Grobler’s header in the 103rd minute and Phala’s fine solo effort in stoppage time.

It means that for only the third time in their history Ahly will not be playing in a continental final, after losing out in the Champions League (1989), Confederation Cup (2010) and now Afcon.
