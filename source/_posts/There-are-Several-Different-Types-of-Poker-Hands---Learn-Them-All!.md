#  There are Several Different Types of Poker Hands - Learn Them All!

There are many different types of poker hands, and it’s important to learn them all if you want to be a successful player. In this article, we will take a look at the most common hands and discuss the best way to play them.

The most basic type of hand is a pair, which is two cards of the same rank. When you have a pair, you should usually raise or bet. If you are playing against multiple opponents, however, you may want to just call if there are several other players in the hand.

A two-pair hand is similar to a pair, but it features two different pairs of cards. In general, you should raise or bet with this hand as well. However, if there are several other players in the hand and the pot is small, you may want to just call instead.

A three-of-a-kind hand is made up of three cards of the same rank. This is a powerful hand that should always be raised or bet when possible.

A straight is made up of five consecutive cards of any suit. This hand can be very powerful, but it’s important to remember that an Ace can be high or low depending on the other cards in the hand. When playing a straight, you should usually raise or bet if there are few opponents in the hand. However, if there are many opponents or the pot is large, you may want to just call instead.

A flush is made up of five cards of the same suit. This hand isn’t as strong as a straight, but it’s still worth raising or betting with if there are few opponents in the hand.

Finally, a royal flush is made up of five cards of the same suit in sequence (10-J-Q-K-A). This is the strongest possible Poker hand and should always be raised or bet when possible.

#  How Many Poker Hands Are There in Total?

As you may know, poker is a card game that involves players betting on the value of their hand. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins. There are many variations of poker, but most games involve 5 cards.

So, how many different poker hands are there in total?

There are a total of 2,598,960 different poker hands!

This number is calculated by factoring in the number of possible card combinations (52!) and the number of different ways those cards can be arranged (5!).

While most poker games involve 5 cards, there are some variants that use 6 or 7 cards. This increases the possible number of hands to 3,744,067 and 11,102,060 respectively.

However, the majority of poker hands (97.3%) are still played with just 5 cards.

#  What is the Highest-Possible Poker Hand?

In poker, the best possible hand is a royal flush. This is made up of the five highest cards in the deck in sequence, all of the same suit: A, K, Q, J, 10.

There are 446 possible royal flushes in a 52-card deck. This makes up 0.00000000000000000000000822% of all hands. If you were to play poker for a billion years, you would only see an average of one royal flush every 2.2 quadrillion hands!

Other high-ranking hands include four of a kind (one in 649,739), a straight flush (one in 32,537), and a full house (one in 694).

In general, the higher the rank of the cards in your hand, the better it is. So if you are lucky enough to be dealt two pairs (two different pairs), this is better than having one pair. And if you are dealt three of a kind, this is better than having two of a kind.

Of course, getting any type of winning hand is always better than getting nothing!
