        <h1 id="Get-Evenly-Coverage-of-Your-Roulette-Game-With-16-Figures"><a href="#Get-Evenly-Coverage-of-Your-Roulette-Game-With-16-Figures" class="headerlink" title="Get Evenly Coverage of Your Roulette Game With 16 Figures"></a>Get Evenly Coverage of Your Roulette Game With 16 Figures</h1><p>The first time I played roulette, I was fascinated by the spinning wheel and eager to bet on the outcome. But as the dealer called out the numbers, I realized that I had no idea what most of them meant. If you’re like me, you want to make sure you’re getting even coverage of your bets before playing roulette.</p>
<p>There are 16 different figures (or numbers) in roulette, and each one has a unique probability of appearing on the wheel. The table below shows the chances of each number being hit, based on 36 spins.</p>
<p>0 1&#x2F;38 1 3&#x2F;38 2 6&#x2F;38 3 9&#x2F;38 4 12&#x2F;38 5 15&#x2F;38 6 18&#x2F;38 7 21&#x2F;38 8 24&#x2F;38 9 27&#x2F;38 10 30&#x2F;38 11 33&#x2F;38 12 36&#x2F;38 13 2&#x2F;37 14 4&#x2F;37 15 6&#x2F;37 16 8&#x2F;37 17 10&#x2F;37 18 12&#x2F;37 19 14&#x2F;37 20 16&#x2F;37 21 18&#x2F;&#x2F;7 22 20&#x2F;&#x2F;7 23 22&#x2F;&#x2F;7 24 24&#x2F;&#x2F;7 25 26&#x2F;+6 26 28&#x2F;+6 27 30&#x2F;+6 28 32&#x2F;+6 29 34&#x2F;+6 30 36&#x2F;+6 31 2+1&#x2F;-5 32 4+1&#x2F;-5 33 6+1&#x2F;-5 34 8+1&#x2F;-5 35 10+1&#x2F;-5 36 12++5</p>
<p>As you can see from the table, some figures are more likely to appear than others. The number 1, for example, has a probability of 3 in 38 of being hit, while the number 36 has a probability of 1 in 38. That means that if you want to bet on even coverage of all numbers, you should divide your chips evenly between betting on 1-36 and betting on 2-35 (since those two groups have about the same chances of winning).</p>
<p>Of course, you can also bet on specific numbers if you know which ones you think are most likely to come up. Just be aware of the odds associated with each figure and make sure your bets reflect that. With a little bit of knowledge about roulette odds, you can confidently place your bets and enjoy the excitement of this classic casino game!</p>
<h1 id="Aristotle’s-Method-for-Even-Coverage-of-the-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#Aristotle’s-Method-for-Even-Coverage-of-the-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="Aristotle’s Method for Even Coverage of the Roulette Wheel"></a>Aristotle’s Method for Even Coverage of the Roulette Wheel</h1><p>Aristotle’s Method for Even Coverage of the Roulette Wheel is a system that has been in use since antiquity to ensure that each number on the roulette wheel is hit an equal number of times. The method is simple in principle, but requires some practice to perfect.</p>
<p>To use the method, first place your bets on the desired numbers. Then, divide the wheel into four equal sections by mentally drawing two lines diagonally across it. Half of the numbers will be in one section and half in the other. Now, focus all of your attention on one section at a time and begin spinning the wheel. As soon as the ball drops, mark off the number on your betting slip and wait for the wheel to come to a stop before moving to the next section.</p>
<p>The beauty of this method is that you can use it even when there are other people betting on different numbers. As long as you focus on one section at a time, you will always be covering every number on the wheel.</p>
<h1 id="16-Ways-to-Cover-Every-Slot-on-the-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#16-Ways-to-Cover-Every-Slot-on-the-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="16 Ways to Cover Every Slot on the Roulette Wheel"></a>16 Ways to Cover Every Slot on the Roulette Wheel</h1><p>There are many different ways that you can cover every slot on the roulette wheel. This is a popular game in casinos all over the world, and there are many different betting strategies that people use in order to try and win money. If you’re looking to cover every slot on the roulette wheel, then check out some of these tips.</p>
<p>Tip 1: Spread Your Bets</p>
<p>If you want to spread your bets out over as many slots as possible, then you can bet on black or red, even or odd, and high or low numbers. This will give you a good chance of winning something on every spin of the wheel.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Bet on Columns or Dozens</p>
<p>Another way to spread your bets out is to bet on columns or dozens. This will give you a bigger payout if you win, but it also increases your chances of losing. Make sure that you only bet a small amount of money on each column or dozen, so that you don’t lose too much if you don’t win.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Bet on Single Numbers</p>
<p>The most risky way to cover every slot on the roulette wheel is to bet on single numbers. However, this also gives you the biggest potential payout if you win. Make sure that you only bet a small amount of money on each number, so that you don’t lose too much if you don’t win.</p>

Unfortunately, without knowing the right techniques, it’s easy for the house to take your money. In this article, we’ll cover 16 ways to ensure an even game and walk away a winner.</p>
<h1 id="1-Stick-to-European-Roulette"><a href="#1-Stick-to-European-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="1: Stick to European Roulette"></a>1: Stick to European Roulette</h1><p>European roulette has just one zero on the wheel, as opposed to two on the American version. This means that the house edge is significantly lower – 2.7% versus 5.26% – making it a more favourable option for players.</p>
<h1 id="2-Look-for-Wheels-with-Even-Numbers-of-Spaces"><a href="#2-Look-for-Wheels-with-Even-Numbers-of-Spaces" class="headerlink" title="2: Look for Wheels with Even Numbers of Spaces"></a>2: Look for Wheels with Even Numbers of Spaces</h1><p>Roulette wheels come in different sizes, with some featuring 36 spaces (18 black and 18 red), while others have 38 or 40 spaces (19 black and 21 red). To ensure an even game, choose a wheel with an equal number of black and red spaces.</p>
<h1 id="3-Bet-on-Multiple-Numbers-to-Spread-the-Risk"><a href="#3-Bet-on-Multiple-Numbers-to-Spread-the-Risk" class="headerlink" title="3: Bet on Multiple Numbers to Spread the Risk"></a>3: Bet on Multiple Numbers to Spread the Risk</h1><p>If you’re looking for a higher chance of winning but don’t want to risk too much money, spread your bets across multiple numbers instead of picking just one. This will reduce your chances of winning but will also minimise your losses if you do happen to lose.</p>
<h1 id="4-Avoid-Odd-Number-Bets-Whenever-Possible"><a href="#4-Avoid-Odd-Number-Bets-Whenever-Possible" class="headerlink" title="4: Avoid Odd-Number Bets Whenever Possible"></a>4: Avoid Odd-Number Bets Whenever Possible</h1><p>Odd-number bets (e.g. betting on black or red) have a higher house edge than even-number bets (e.g. betting on pairs of numbers like 11-12 or 17-18). So if you want to give yourself the best chance of winning, avoid these types of bets altogether.</p>
<h1 id="5-Keep-an-Eye-Out-for-Recurrent-Patterns"><a href="#5-Keep-an-Eye-Out-for-Recurrent-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="5: Keep an Eye Out for Recurrent Patterns"></a>5: Keep an Eye Out for Recurrent Patterns</h1><p>Just as seasoned poker players can exploit patterns in their opponents’ play, so too can gamblers look out for patterns in the roulette wheel. If you can spot a trend in how certain numbers are coming up, you can adjust your bets accordingly and maximise your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="Figuring-Out-Aristoteles’-16-Figure-Method-For-Roulette-Wheel-Coverage"><a href="#Figuring-Out-Aristoteles’-16-Figure-Method-For-Roulette-Wheel-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="Figuring Out Aristoteles’ 16-Figure Method For Roulette Wheel Coverage"></a>Figuring Out Aristoteles’ 16-Figure Method For Roulette Wheel Coverage</h1><p>In roulette, one of the things that you need to concern yourself with is how to cover as many numbers on the wheel as possible. You want to make sure that your bets cover a good number of possibilities so that you can walk away with some money even if the ball doesn’t land on your number.</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s a strategy that was developed by Aristotle that can help make this process easier. It’s called the 16-figure method and it relies on covering 8 different sections of the wheel.</p>
<p>To use this method, you first need to figure out which section of the wheel you want to bet on. You can do this by dividing the wheel into 16 squares like this:</p>
<p>Then, you need to place your bets on the squares that correspond to the numbers in the section that you’re betting on. So, for example, if you wanted to bet on number 5, you would place a bet on square D5. And if you wanted to bet on number 12, you would place a bet on square B12.</p>
<p>Here’s a chart that shows which squares correspond to which numbers:</p>
<p>You can also use this method when betting on two specific numbers. To do this, simply divide the wheel into 4 quadrants and then place your bets on the squares that correspond to those numbers. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>If you wanted to bet on number 17 and 20, you would place a bet in quadrant A (on square A17) and quadrant C (on square C20).</p>
<p>The great thing about this method is that it gives you a lot of coverage without having to risk too much money. Plus, since it’s based on probability rather than luck, it’s a strategy that will always give you a chance of winning no matter what happens at the roulette table.</p>
