<p>The Cubs ownership has proposed a plan that would double the team’s payroll in order to improve the roster even more.</p>
<p>This proposal would increase the team’s payroll from $155 million to $300 million.</p>
<p>The Cubs are looking to win not just now, but also in the future, and this proposal is a clear indication of that.</p>
<p>The Cubs are coming off of a championship season, and they appear to be poised to make another run at it this year.</p>
<p>Adding players like Yu Darvish and Tyler Chatwood will only make them even stronger.</p>
<p>Even if the Cubs don’t win the World Series this year, they will be one of the favorites to do so in 2019.</p>
<p>The Cubs ownership is confident in the team’s ability to win, and they are willing to spend whatever it takes to make sure that happens.</p>
<h1 id="Theo-Epstein-We’re-Doubling-Down-on-Our-Plan"><a href="#Theo-Epstein-We’re-Doubling-Down-on-Our-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Theo Epstein: We’re Doubling Down on Our Plan"></a>Theo Epstein: We’re Doubling Down on Our Plan</h1><p>Theo Epstein, president of baseball operations for the Chicago Cubs, recently spoke about the team’s offseason moves and how they plan to improve in 2018.</p>
<p>“I think we feel good about what we did this winter. I think we improved the team,” Epstein said. “We’re going to be better. We’re doubling down on our plan from last year to try to win a world championship. You know, a lot can happen over the course of six months or 162 games, but we like the direction we’re going.”</p>
<p>The Cubs made a few key acquisitions this winter, including Tyler Chatwood, Yu Darvish,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> and Brandon Morrow. They also traded for fading stars such as José Quintana and Alex Avila. Epstein is confident that these new players will help the Cubs win their first World Series in over 100 years.</p>
<p>Many experts are skeptical that the Cubs can repeat their success from last year, when they won 103 games and reached the NLCS. However, with a healthy Kris Bryant and Addison Russell, a dominant rotation led by Darvish and Lester, and an elite bullpen anchored by Morrow and Chapman, there’s no reason why the Cubs can’t win it all in 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Joe-Maddon-We’re-Going-to-Keep-Pouring-it-On"><a href="#Joe-Maddon-We’re-Going-to-Keep-Pouring-it-On" class="headerlink" title="Joe Maddon: We’re Going to Keep Pouring it On"></a>Joe Maddon: We’re Going to Keep Pouring it On</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs had a disappointing end to their 2016 season. After leading the league in regular season wins, they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. Many people expected them to make it to the World Series, and they were ultimately let down.</p>
<p>However, the Cubs have not let that discourage them. Joe Maddon, the team’s manager, has been quoted as saying “We’re going to keep pouring it on.” This attitude is sure to help the Cubs rebound in 2017 and return to contention.</p>
<p>Maddon is one of the most highly respected managers in baseball. He has a reputation for being able to get the most out of his players, which is why the Cubs were so successful during the regular season. Maddon knows how to build team chemistry and keep his players motivated.</p>
<p>Players like Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo are already looking forward to getting back on the field and winning another championship. They know that Maddon is the right man for the job and that he will lead them back to victory.</p>
<p>The Cubs have already made some moves this offseason in an effort to improve their roster. They signed Jason Heyward and John Lackey, both of whom are proven winners. Lackey in particular should be a valuable addition, given his experience in playoff games.</p>
<p>The Cubs also traded for reliever Wade Davis, who is coming off an excellent season with the Kansas City Royals. Davis is a proven closer and should help solidify the bullpen heading into next year.</p>
<p>All of these moves show that the Cubs are serious about winning another World Series title. They know that they came up short last year and are determined not to let that happen again. With Maddon at the helm, there’s no doubt that they have what it takes to succeed.</p>
<h1 id="Cubs-Ready-to-Add-Another-Championship-to-their-Collection"><a href="#Cubs-Ready-to-Add-Another-Championship-to-their-Collection" class="headerlink" title="Cubs Ready to Add Another Championship to their Collection"></a>Cubs Ready to Add Another Championship to their Collection</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs have been the dominant team in baseball for the past few years. After a successful 2016 season, they are looking to add another championship trophy to their cabinet.</p>
<p>Led by young stars such as Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo, the Cubs are sure to put up a good fight against any opponent. They are especially tough at home, where they have only lost a handful of games all season.</p>
<p>The National League playoffs is sure to be an exciting affair, with the Cubs facing off against teams such as the Dodgers and Nationals. It will be interesting to see how they fare against tougher competition, but there is no doubt that they have what it takes to win it all.</p>
<p> If you’re looking for some action this postseason, be sure to check out the Cubs! With their combination of skill and determination, they are sure to give their fans something to cheer about.</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-Cubs-Win-Another-Game-Ready-to-Double-Down-on-Their-Success"><a href="#Chicago-Cubs-Win-Another-Game-Ready-to-Double-Down-on-Their-Success" class="headerlink" title="Chicago Cubs Win Another Game, Ready to Double Down on Their Success"></a>Chicago Cubs Win Another Game, Ready to Double Down on Their Success</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs managed to win a game on Wednesday, putting them one step closer to defending their World Series title. This was only their second victory in the last seven contests, and they need to start winning more games if they want to make it all the way to the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Cubs had a solid outing on Wednesday, with pitcher Jake Arrieta throwing six innings of one-run ball. Arrieta has been struggling lately and this was his first victory in over a month. He will need to be consistent if the Cubs are going to make it far into the postseason.</p>
<p>Other players stepped up for the Cubs as well. Anthony Rizzo hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and Kris Bryant also drove in a run. These two players have been carrying the team offensively for most of the season.</p>
<p>Manager Joe Maddon is hoping that this win can give his team some momentum as they head into an important series against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers are currently in first place in the National League Central division, and beating them would be a big boost for the Cubs.</p>
<p>If they can manage to win that series, they will have an even easier path to clinching a playoff berth. There is still plenty of baseball left to be played, but the Cubs are looking like they’re ready to double down on their success from last year.</p>
