The objective of the game is to draw cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer’s total. Players can compete against the dealer or other players.</p>
<p>Blackjack has some of the best odds in the casino and offers a wide range of betting options. With a bit of practice and some sound advice, you can improve your chances of winning at blackjack every time.</p>
<p>The first step is to understand the basic rules of blackjack: </p>
<p>There are a few things that you can do to improve your chances of winning at blackjack: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always split pairs of eights or aces.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never split 3s, 4s, or 5s.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split 6s only against a dealer’s 2, 3, or 6.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double down on 11 if the dealer shows a 2-6.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double down on 10 if the dealer shows a 3-6.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stand on 17 if the dealer shows 2-6.</p>

<h1 id="Get-the-Edge-at-Blackjack-with-O’Neill’s-Strategies"><a href="#Get-the-Edge-at-Blackjack-with-O’Neill’s-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Get the Edge at Blackjack with O’Neill’s Strategies"></a>Get the Edge at Blackjack with O’Neill’s Strategies</h1><p>Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, learning how to get the edge at blackjack is essential for success. In this article, we will explore some of the most effective blackjack strategies devised by renowned casino expert Lawrence O’Neill.</p>
<p>O’Neill’s first strategy is called the “depth of penetration” method. This approach is based on the assumption that the house edge increases as the number of decks used in blackjack decreases. To take advantage of this, you should try to find casinos that use as few decks as possible.</p>
<p>Another key element of O’Neill’s strategy is understanding how to count cards. This involves keeping track of the proportion of high and low cards that have been played, in order to anticipate when high-value cards are likely to be dealt next. Although card counting can be difficult to master, it can be highly profitable if done correctly.</p>
<p>O’Neill also recommends placing smaller bets when the odds are in your favour, and increasing your stakes when the odds are against you. By doing this, you can minimise your losses while maximising your profits.</p>
<p>Finally, O’Neill advises players to avoid table hopping. This is when you move from one blackjack table to another in search of a more favourable game. By sticking with one table and using sound betting strategies, you can minimise your risk while maximising your potential rewards.</p>

The edge isn’t huge - typically around 1% - but it’s enough to make the casino a winner in the long run. </p>
<p>This is particularly true of blackjack, where the player can bust if they hit too many cards and come up over 21. </p>
<p>However, there are ways to reduce the house edge and give yourself a better chance of winning. In this article, we’ll look at some tips from blackjack expert Kevin O’Neill that will help you do just that. </p>
<ol>
<li>Know your odds<br>One of the most important things to know when playing blackjack is your odds of winning. This varies depending on the number of decks being used, but with two decks there’s about a 50&#x2F;50 chance of winning or losing. With four or more decks, the odds start to favour the house, with around a 2% edge.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re familiar with your odds, you can make better decisions about when to hit and stand, and also when to double down or split pairs. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Count cards<br>Card counting is one strategy that players can use to improve their chances of winning. It involves keeping track of how many high and low value cards have been played, so that you know when it’s favourable to bet big or take extra risks.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not easy to learn how to count cards effectively, but if you can it can give you a significant edge over the house. casinos are aware of card counters and will often ban them from playing if they catch them counting cards. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Don’t bet big money early on<br>When you’re starting out at blackjack, it’s best not to bet too much money on each hand. This way, you won’t lose all your chips if you happen to lose a few hands in a row. Start by betting small amounts and increase your bets as you become more confident in your ability to win. </li>
<li>Stay disciplined One of the biggest mistakes players make is getting carried away and making stupid bets based on emotion rather than reason. If you stick to sensible betting limits and only bet when you have a good chance of winning, you’ll be much more likely to come out ahead in the long run.</li>
</ol>

Thankfully, there are strategies that you can use in order to make yourself a more profitable player. In this article, we will discuss some of the best strategies that you can use courtesy of blackjack expert Kevin O’Neill.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is to never take risks that could put your entire bankroll at risk. In other words, make sure that you are playing within your means. If you find yourself consistently losing money, then it is time to leave the table and come back another day.</p>
<p>Another key strategy that O’Neill recommends is to always split Aces and 8s. By splitting these two hands, you are essentially giving yourself twice the chance of winning money. Furthermore, if you are fortunate enough to receive an Ace as one of your cards, you can then split again and have four chances of winning instead of just two.</p>
<p>If the dealer is showing a 4, 5, or 6, O’Neill recommends hitting on any hand totaling 17 or less. This strategy will give you the best chance of winning against these dealers’ cards. Conversely, if the dealer is showing a 2 or 3, O’Neill suggests doubling down on any hand totaling 9 or 11.</p>
<p>O’Neill also advises players to always take insurance when offered by the dealer. This is a proposition bet that will see you lose half of your original bet amount but guarantees a win should the dealer have blackjack. While it may not seem like a great deal at first glance, it can actually be quite profitable in the long run if used correctly.</p>
<p>By following these simple tips and strategies, you can make yourself a more successful blackjack player and increase your chances of winning money. So next time you hit the casino floor, be sure to keep these pointers in mind and enjoy some hopefully profitable gaming sessions!</p>
<h1 id="Learn-How-to-Win-Every-Time-Playing-Blackjack-with-O’Neill’s-Tips"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Win-Every-Time-Playing-Blackjack-with-O’Neill’s-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Win Every Time Playing Blackjack with O’Neill’s Tips"></a>Learn How to Win Every Time Playing Blackjack with O’Neill’s Tips</h1><p>When you walk into a casino, the first thing you see is the long row of blackjack tables. This is because blackjack is one of the most popular casino games. </p>
<p>The object of blackjack is to beat the dealer. You can do this by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a blackjack), or by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. </p>
<p>If your first two cards total 21, you automatically win unless the dealer has a blackjack too. If your first two cards are not a natural 21, you can choose to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what you have). </p>
<p>The idea is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and to beat the dealer’s hand. Here are some tips that will help you win every time playing blackjack:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t Bust – One of the biggest mistakes people make when playing blackjack is busting (going over 21). If your total exceeds 21, you automatically lose, even if the dealer goes over too. So try not to take any risks and keep your bets low until you have a better idea of what you’re doing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know When To Stand – Another common mistake players make is standing when they should hit instead. always remember that it’s better to have less than 21 than it is to go over. So be sure to hit if your cards add up to less than 17. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep Track Of The Dealer’s Cards – One reason why some people lose at blackjack is because they don’t keep track of what the dealer’s upcard is. The dealer’s upcard determines whether you should hit or stand, so be sure to pay attention! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Split Aces And Eights – Aces and eights are both good cards to split, since they have the potential to make a strong hand. When you split aces, you get two cards for each ace; when you split eights, you get two cards for each eight. This gives you more chances of beating the dealer’s hand. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Basic Strategy – One way to improve your chances of winning at blackjack is by using basic strategy . This involves making specific decisions depending on the cards that are dealt, and takes into account things like whether the Dealer has an Ace upcard and how many decks are being used in the game . By using basic strategy ,you can reduce the house edge from around 0 . 5 % down to around 0 . 1 % .</p>
</li>
